# 2026-02-13 - Full Stack Deployment Research

## Problem
User wants Replit-like experience where they can "vibe code" and have automatic deployment without manual setup for each project.

## Requirements
- Vibe coding (tell AI what to build → auto deploy)
- One URL for everything (frontend + backend + database)
- Minimal manual intervention
- Cost-effective

## Research Done

### Platform Comparisons

| Platform | Like Replit | Database | Auto Deploy | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Bolt.new | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Supabase/Vercel | ✅ | Free / $19 |
| Replit | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Built-in | ✅ | $15+ |
| Railway | ⭐⭐⭐ | Built-in | ✅ Git push | $5+ |
| Render | ⭐⭐⭐ | Built-in | ✅ Git push | Free / $7+ |
| Zeabur | ⭐⭐⭐ | Built-in | ✅ Git push | Free |

### Key Findings

1. **Bolt.new** - Most similar to Replit, AI-powered, deploys to Vercel, needs Supabase for DB
2. **Replit** - Original experience, built-in DB, but expensive
3. **Railway** - Best value, simple, built-in PostgreSQL
4. **Zeabur** - Current solution, but requires manual service setup per project

## User Decision Pending

User is deciding between:
1. Bolt.new + Supabase (AI vibe coding)
2. Replit (original experience)
3. Railway (simple hosting)

## Current Exam System Status
- Backend: `exam-system-backend` repo on GitHub
- Frontend: Merged into backend repo
- Deployment: Attempting Zeabur all-in-one (has issues)
- Database: PostgreSQL on Zeabur (deployed)
- Schema: SQL ready to run

## Action Items
- Wait for user decision on platform
- If Railway: help migrate from Zeabur to Railway
- If Bolt.new: help set up new workflow
