## Skills Investigation
- Investigated OpenClaw skills for calendar, music, writing, budgeting
- Apple Calendar skill: REQUIRES macOS (not usable on Zeabur Linux)
- Google Calendar (gogcli): Requires complex OAuth setup + Google Cloud Console
- Suno AI: Has paid international account but requires additional setup
- **Decision**: Skip external skills for now, use Obsidian for calendar management

## System Preferences
- **Auto-memory**: Enabled - I will summarize important points after each conversation
- **Token optimization**: Memory-based context to reduce token usage

## OpenClaw Setup Confirmed
